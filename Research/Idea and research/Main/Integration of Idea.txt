Here are some ways you can integrate features that go beyond looks in your dating app:

**Matching Algorithm:**

* **Personality Assessments:**  Incorporate personality quizzes or assessments that delve deeper than basic interests. Consider using established frameworks like Myers-Briggs or OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) to find matches compatible on a deeper level.
* **Values Matching:**  Allow users to identify their core values (e.g., honesty, family, adventure) and match them with others who share similar priorities. This can be especially helpful for users seeking long-term relationships.
* **Lifestyle Matching:**  Integrate questions about hobbies, interests, and lifestyle preferences (e.g., active vs. homebody, foodie vs. health-conscious) to connect users who enjoy similar activities and life approaches.
* **Interactive Matching:**  Move beyond static profiles.  Incorporate features like voice prompts or video introductions to give users a better sense of someone's personality beyond photos.

**Profile Building:**

* **Go Beyond Bios:**  Encourage users to create profiles that showcase their personality, values, and interests through prompts, stories, or even short videos. 
* **Skill Sharing:**  Allow users to highlight skills or talents beyond the professional realm (e.g., playing music, cooking, volunteering). This can spark conversation starters and reveal shared passions. 
* **Voice Notes/Recordings:**  Integrate features for users to record short introductions or answer prompts with their voice. This can add a more personal touch compared to just text.

**Matching Activities:**

* **Gamified Compatibility Tests:**  Develop interactive quizzes or games that assess compatibility in a fun and engaging way. This can spark conversation and reveal shared values or interests in a less forced manner.
* **Virtual Shared Experiences:**  Offer virtual experiences like online games, museum tours, or cooking classes for matched users to participate in together. This can break the ice and create a sense of connection beyond just chatting.

**Remember:**

* **Balance is Key:**  While going beyond looks is important, don't neglect the role of visual attraction entirely.  Maybe allow users to rate both appearance and personality aspects.
* **Data Privacy:**  Ensure user data collected through assessments or activities is secure and used responsibly for matching purposes.
* **User Verification:**  Implement verification systems to ensure the information users provide about their personalities and interests is accurate. 

By incorporating these features, your dating app can move beyond superficial swiping and create a space for more meaningful connections based on shared values, personalities, and interests.
