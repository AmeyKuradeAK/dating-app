Tinder and Bumble partially fulfill some of the basic ideas for a dating app, but they have room for improvement. Here's a breakdown:

**Matching Algorithm:**

* **Focus on Looks:** Both Tinder and Bumble rely heavily on swiping through profiles with a focus on appearance. While Bumble has prompts, they aren't a core part of the matching algorithm. 
* **Niche interests:** Neither app caters to specific niches or hobbies for matching.
* **Value Alignment:**  There's no direct matching based on values or goals in either app.

**User Experience:**

* **Curated Swiping:** Neither app limits the number of profiles displayed daily. 
* **Conversation Starters:** Bumble offers prompts within profiles, but Tinder does not have built-in conversation starters.
* **Focus on Quality:** Both allow detailed profiles, but verification is limited, and the focus can still be on quantity of swipes. 
* **Safety Features:** Both offer basic reporting features, but verification could be improved.

**Additional Features:**

* **Virtual Date Tools:** Neither app offers integrated video chat or interactive games.
* **Community Building:** Neither focuses on building a community beyond romantic connections.

**Overall:**

* Tinder and Bumble offer a convenient way to meet people, but they don't fully address the pain points of shallow connections, time investment, and user safety.

**Here's where they fulfill the basic ideas:**

* **Tinder:**  Large user base can increase match chances, statistically saving time compared to smaller apps.
* **Bumble:** Prompts and focus on women initiating conversations might encourage more thoughtful interactions and deter superficiality to some extent.  The 24-hour window could also prevent ghosting to a degree.

Dating apps are constantly evolving, and new features are emerging to address user concerns.  There's always space for innovation, and your ideas for a niche focus, value-based matching, or even virtual date tools could be the key differentiator for a new dating app.
