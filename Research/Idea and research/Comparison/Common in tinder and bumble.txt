Here's what Tinder and Bumble have in common:

* **Swipe-based system:** Both apps rely on a simple swiping right for "like" and left for "dislike" to indicate interest in profiles. 
* **Matching:** If two users swipe right on each other's profiles, a "match" is created, enabling them to chat.
* **Basic profile creation:** Both allow you to build a profile with photos, a bio, and sometimes links to social media.
* **Freemium model:** Both offer basic features for free, with additional features available through paid subscriptions.

These similarities make them easy to learn and use, especially if you're new to dating apps.
